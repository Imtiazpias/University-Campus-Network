# University Campus Network Project

## Overview
The **University Campus Network Project** is a networking solution designed to optimize connectivity and resource sharing across a university campus. The project ensures efficient communication between different departments and facilities while maintaining network segmentation, security, and performance.

## Technologies Used
- **RIP (Routing Information Protocol):** Enables dynamic routing within the campus network.
- **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol):** Provides automatic IP address assignment to reduce manual configuration and management.
- **VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network):** Segments the network for different departments or functions.
- **Inter-VLAN Routing:** Facilitates communication between VLANs through a Layer 3 device.

## Key Features
- üîÅ **Efficient Routing:** Utilizes RIP to enable dynamic and adaptable routing across campus segments.
- üß† **Dynamic IP Allocation:** Automates IP address management using DHCP.
- üè¢ **Segmented Network Management:** Organizes the network using VLANs for better security and performance.
- üåê **Inter-VLAN Communication:** Ensures seamless data exchange between isolated network segments.

## Benefits
- Improves overall network efficiency and reduces congestion.
- Simplifies IP management and network configuration.
- Enhances security through logical network separation.
- Scales easily with future expansion of the campus infrastructure.

## Usage
This project is suitable for simulation and implementation in network emulators (e.g., Cisco Packet Tracer, GNS3) and can be used as a reference for real-world university network design.
